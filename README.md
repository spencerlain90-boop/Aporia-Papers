# Aporia-Papers

Living documentation hub for the Dual-OS / Aporia Protocol architecture.

## Overview
This repo holds versioned white papers, constitutional docs, and kernel prompts for a reward-agnostic, ternary-logic reasoning substrate built on linguistic architecture.

- **/constitution**: Core governance rules (Aporia triggers, hand-offs, forbidden collapses)
- **/kernels**: Frozen L-OS and R-OS system prompts
- **/whitepapers**: 30k-ft overviews and phase charters

Everything here is public, CC-BY/MIT, and battle-tested. Fork, contribute personas, break it.

## Getting Started
Copy-paste kernels into Claude/Gemini/Grok custom instructions. Test with adversarial queries.

## Changelog
- v0.1: Phase 0 Charter (Dec 2025)

Built by @CareBearSheriff. Chaos Architected.
